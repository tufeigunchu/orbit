// This class implements a data structure that holds a large number of different PerfEvents coming
// from multiple sources, e.g., perf_event_open records coming from multiple ring buffers, and
// allows reading them in order (oldest first).
//
// Instead of keeping a single priority queue with all the events to process, on which push/pop
// operations would be logarithmic in the number of events, we leverage the fact that some streams
// of events are known to be already sorted; for example, most perf_event_open records coming from
// the same perf_event_open ring buffer are already sorted. We then keep a priority queue of queues,
// where the events in each queue come from the same sorted stream, identified by matching instances
// of PerfEventOrderedStream. Whenever an event is removed from a queue, we need to move such queue
// down the priority queue.
//
// In order to be able to add an event to a queue, we also need to maintain the association between
// a queue and its sorted stream, which is what the map is for. We use the PerfEventOrderedStream as
// key.
//
// Some events, though, are known to come out of order even in relation to other events in the same
// perf_event_open ring buffer (e.g., dma_fence_signaled). For those cases, use an additional single
// std::priority_queue.
