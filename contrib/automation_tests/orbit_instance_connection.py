"""Test Instance connections in the Session Setup Window 

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved.

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to by run from 64 bit python.

This automation script does the following:
 - Start Orbit
 - Connect to the first instance in the list
 - Disconnect from that instance and verify correct overlay behaviour and 
    that instances exist after the disconnect
 - Click on the refresh button and verify correct overlay behaviour and
    that instances exist after the refresh
