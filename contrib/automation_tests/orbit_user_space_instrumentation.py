"""Instrument a single function in Orbit using user space instrumentation.

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved and
"hello_ggp_standalone" has to be started.

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to by run from 64 bit python.

This automation script covers a basic workflow:
 - connect to a gamelet, select a process and load debug symbols
 - instrument a function
 - take a capture with Orbit's own dynamic instrumentation (not relying on kernel uprobes)
 - verify the hooked function is recorded
