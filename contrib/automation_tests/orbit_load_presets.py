"""Apply two presets in Orbit using pywinauto.

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved and
"hello_ggp_standalone" has to be started. Two presets named
draw_frame_in_hello_ggp_1_68.opr and ggp_issue_frame_token_in_hello_ggp_1_68.opr
(hooking the functions DrawFrame and GgpIssueFrameToken) need to exist in the
preset folder.

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to by run from  64 bit python.
