"""Load symbols for PE/COFF modules.

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved and
our "triangle application" has to be started.

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to by run from 64 bit python.

This automation script covers a basic workflow:
 - start Orbit
 - connect to a gamelet
 - select a process and load debug symbols for a binary and a shared object
