"""Verify loading a capture in Orbit using pywinauto.

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved and
"hello_ggp_standalone" has to be started. Further, Orbit needs to be started.
Also, the captures directory should be cleared.

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to be run from 64 bit python.

This automation script covers a basic workflow:
 - load an old, unsupported capture and verify this fails with a message
 - load a supported capture
 - verify that the scheduler track is present and contains timers
 - verify that the frame track is present and contains timers
 - verify that the tracks from manual instrumentation are present
 - verify that the memory tracks are present
 - verify that an iterator can be added to "TestFunc2"
 - verify that "TestFunc2" was called exactly 1257 times
 - take a capture and verify there is a corresponding capture in the latest captures list which contains the tracks
