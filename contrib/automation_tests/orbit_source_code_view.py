"""Show source code for a single function in Orbit using pywinauto.

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved and
"hello_ggp_c" has to be started. Additionally "hello_ggp_c.debug" needs
to be in Orbit's symbol path. A precompiled version of the hello_ggp
project can be found in the integration test bucket (authentication needed):
https://storage.cloud.google.com/orbit-integration-test-data/hello_ggp.zip
In addition to the executable, also the source code file "main.c" from the
example is needed. The path to this file can be given by the command line
argument "--source_code_file". It needs to be an absolute path!

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to by run from 64 bit python.

This automation script covers a basic workflow:
 - start Orbit
 - connect to a gamelet
 - select a process and load debug symbols
 - choose "Go to Source code" for a function
 - set up source code mapping
